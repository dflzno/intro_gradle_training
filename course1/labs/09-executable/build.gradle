/*
    1. Define a C++ executable named 'hello'
        (sources for this executable are in the conventional location).
        Hint: Would the project need any plug-ins applied?
    2. Build and install the executable. Notice the tasks that are executed. Execute a second time and see what happens.
        Hint: 'gradle tasks' may help decide the correct task to run.
    3. Inspect the various generated files under 'build'. Note the location of the generated object files, binary and install image.
    4. Run the hello executable via the install image script in build/install.
